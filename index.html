          Subham bhaiya was quite famous for meme lord. He told us various embarassing stories of him in college. Plus, he is a hell of a coder. Ujjwal bhaiya was the one who guided us for the activities, whether being a club visit or any other
          college
          fests, academics etc..
          We went ghats together, agriculture farm and varuous more places along. Will miss those days‚ù§Ô∏è

          It's awesome to have seniors like you. I feel privileged to have met you. Being a member of HHC, I have been lucky enough to interact
          quite frequently with you guys. We all learnt a lot from you and you all inspired me in so many ways.
          We feel like family together. We shared moments together.I still remember my first meeeting with Ojha and Khare bhaiaya and that
          morning boating at Assi ghat.We could've shared some more memories if Corona hadn't disrupted us.

          I have no hesitation in claiming that Shubham bhaiya is among the most humble and chilled out seniors that
          I have come across in our college. And the Bilaspur connection just makes it sweeter. From nearly managing to miss our train
          ( I‚Äôll forever be grateful for your help with my luggage) to the many sessions of ‚Äúgyaan‚Äù at your room, it was ride.
          You were a fabulous HHC secy, even if you don‚Äôt consider yourself the same.
